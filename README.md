# WeatherApp

WeatherApp is designed to allow separate users to use a CLI to log in
to an environment where they can find out about the current weather.
They are able to ask about most major cities in the world, and save
their preferred locations to their user profile. In their collection of
locations, they can ask different questions about the current conditions,
including temperature, humidity, windspeed, and precipitation. The program
will answer these questions, and return some helpful advice for the user in
preparing for their day. Once they exit the program, their past locations are
saved for their future sessions.

# Installation:

1. Clone the repository <br>`git clone [this repository]`

2. Run the program's run file in terminal <br>`ruby bin/run.rb`

# Enjoy!
